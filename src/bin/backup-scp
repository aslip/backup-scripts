Copies latest automated backup to the specified destination over SCP.

Usage
    backup-scp server path

Examples
    backup-scp user@example.com wmdemo

Notes
    BACKUP_DIR/BACKUP_DATE is copied recursively to 'server:/path'. If path has 
    spaces, you should not escape them - the script will do this for you.
EOF
    exit 1
}

# see http://dennisthomsen.dk/2010/07/scp-ambiguous-target/
# basically, if scp destination has spaces, they should be escaped by backslash
escaped_path=`echo "$path" | perl -pe 's/ /\\\\ /g'` # backslash should be quoted inside backquotes
# copy recursively; - this is the only way to make dirs with scp
# preserve access times, modify times, modes etc;
scp -rp "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_DATE" "$server:/$escaped_path"
